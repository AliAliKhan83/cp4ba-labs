# Process Mining
## Overview
Process mining is a family of techniques in the field of process management that support the analysis of real business processes based on event logs.  During process mining, specialized data mining algorithms are applied in order to identify trends, patterns, and details contained in event logs recorded by an information system. Process mining aims to improve process efficiency and understanding of processes.
