# IBM Business Automation Insights
## Overview

IBM Business Automation Insights (BAI) is a cloud capability to capture end to end business data (events) from Cloud Pak for Automation (CP4A) platform components to operational data store and long-term store (data lake). 
BAI provides real-time operational visibility to Business Managers via custom or pre-built set of dashboards. Custom dashboards can be built by IT (using Kibana) or business users (using Business Performance Center).
The data collected by BAI and stored in the data lake can be used to inject AI into CP4A platform, for example it can be used to make recommendations to business managers and knowledge workers.
Business Performance Center is a no-code monitoring application native to IBM Business Automation Insights. You can design and share dashboards in minutes that capture business data in near real time and provide real time awareness of important business activities and processes.
