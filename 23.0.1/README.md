# IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation 23.0.1 Labs

To be able to perform labs listed below, you need to have IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (either Enterprise or Starter deployment) installed and have imported the Client Onboarding scenario as described [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario).

A fast way for Business Partners and IBMers with access to IBM TechZone, is to utilize [Jam-in-a-Box](http://ibm.biz/Jam-in-a-Box) with its associated environment. Another way is to deploy an IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Enterprise pattern cluster using the rapid deployment scripts as describes [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment). 

The table below lists all capabilities that we currently have labs for. A capability may contain one or more labs depending on the complexity.
