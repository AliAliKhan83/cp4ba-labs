# IBM FileNet Content Manager

## Overview

IBM FileNet Content Manager is a flexible, full-featured content management solution that provides the foundation for IBM Cloud PakÂ® for Business Automation. In labs you will get introduced to important core concepts, and have the chance to experiment with new features of FileNet Content Platform Engine and Content Navigator. So you will learn about the new GraphQL integration, explore the Recovery Bin feature in its new Group-Recovery Bin configuration, and try out the new Consistency Checker Sweep job to trigger auto-correction of an Advanced Storage Area. On the core concepts, you will learn how to create new Object Stores and Storage Areas in the Container releases, create Entry Templates on Content Navigator, and how to install and use the FileNet Deployment Manager to deploy entities between Object Stores.
