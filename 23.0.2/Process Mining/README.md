# Process Mining
## Overview
Process Mining is a family of techniques in process management that support the analysis of actual business processes based on event logs.  During process mining, specialized data mining algorithms are applied to identify trends, patterns, and details in event logs recorded by an information system. Process mining aims to improve process efficiency and understanding of processes.

Task Mining is the discovery, monitoring, and analysis of user interaction data on desktops through the recording of frontend activities.
